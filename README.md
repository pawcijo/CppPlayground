It includes examples showcasing both fundamental and advanced language features.
You can find basic information about thins like: type deduction, smart pointers, Polymorphism, throwing and catching exceptions, virtual functions and classes,deep and shallow copy differences and more ... .

shows some information about the code.

You can also debug the code to lern more and get some more details.
